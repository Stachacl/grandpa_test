    "paragraph1": "According to the United Nations Demographic Report, in Europe, 25% of the population is already aged 60 years or over. That proportion is projected to reach 35% in 2050.  It is time to ask yourself: is your website ia a \"grandpa friendly\" ?",
    "paragraph2": "My grandfather is 78 years old and this year he is breaking into the IT industry as a User Experience tester.  He was always interested in technologies but even though modern interfaces are not always easy for him to navigate.  Poor grandpa often feels lost and frustrated.  If only he could tell all the website owners, what is the hardest thing on their website to deal with. That would drastically improve the experience on their website for all users.",
    "paragraph3": "If you are the website owner or the developer - contact my grandpa via the contact form. He will test your website and send you a video of himself using your website. He will provide  you with an advice on how to improve your interface based on what he is struggling with."
